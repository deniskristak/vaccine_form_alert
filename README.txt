script, which continually refreshes and parses very badly made form for COVID19 vaccination registration. Problem with the form is/was that a user had to manually keep refreshing the page until there was a new available date (usually caused by another user cancelling his vaccination appointment) which he could sign up to. This script makes the process a bit easier by alerting user (right now - sound alert, optionally SMS/email/mobile notifications) that there is a new free date available.
